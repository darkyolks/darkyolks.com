Hi, my name is Grant Wilsey. Cybersecurity is passion of mine that I'm also lucky enough to call a profession. As I'm inherently curious and eager to learn, I've found this field is the optimal path due to its everchanging nature.

I'm currently working as a Security Analyst with four years of IT/Security experience.

### Why the **darkyolks**?

The most nutritious, rich, luxurious eggs come from happy, healthy, well fed chickens. These eggs always taste the best and will always carry a rich dark yolk within them. These eggs just simply taste better so I always aim to get these whenever possible. Simple as that!

I'm creating this blog with the goal of highlighting a few of the cool things that I've learned and to *eventually* showcase some of the more obscure, juicy oddities found in the cyber world. I like to call these, ***dark yolks***.
