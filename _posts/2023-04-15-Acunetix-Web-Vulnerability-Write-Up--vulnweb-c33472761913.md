### Acunetix Web Vulnerability Write Up, vulnweb

#### A brief report on enumerating and exploiting vulnerabilities found on Acunetix test websites and providing remdiation feedback.

**Summary Title**: SQLi Vulnerability that allows anyone to login as ‘admin’, leading to further exploit that reveals sensitive server-related information.

### **Target:** testasp.vulnweb.com

**Technical severity**: Very High (based on [Zofixer](https://zofixer.com/vulnerability-definitions/) rating)

**Location of Vulnerability:** <http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php>

**Description & Solution:** Login page is susceptible to SQL Injection, allowing any user to login as admin. Using SQLMap and BurpSuite, I was able to identify the string **‘ or 1=1 or ‘’=’** can be injected into the **tbUsername** field to login as ‘admin’.

Once logged in, I was able to use the admin SessionID to continue test with SQLMap.

This revealed that there were more exploitable fields with payloads on the site, such as time-based Blind and Microsoft SQL Server, Stacked Queries.

Using the Microsoft SQL Server, Stacked Queries payload discovered by SQLMap, I was able to get a list of six databases in testasp.vulnweb.com:

**Remediation/Mitigations:**

One recommendation for mitigating this type of attack would be to use prepared statements and utilize parameterized queries, ensuring users/attackers are not able to manipulate the intent behind query.

**Summary Title**: Default credentials in place that allow any user to sign in as admin, without requiring password.

### **Target:** testhtml5.vulnweb.com

**Technical severity**: Very High (based on [Zofixer](https://zofixer.com/vulnerability-definitions/) rating)

**Location of Vulnerability:** <http://testhtml5.vulnweb.com/#/popular>

**Description & Solution:** Site in question has a login page on the home screen. Clicking on it allows a any user to sign in without requiring password.

Once logged in as admin, the attacker can then exploit further vulnerabilities to harvest sensitive information, deface the site, or deploy phishing campaigns.

**Remediation/Mitigations:**

Remediations for this vulnerability are to change or disable the default credentials immediately and to make sure the passwords are long and unique. Reviewing if a system is using default credentials can be done through various tools, some free and others paid.

**Summary Title**: Local File Inclusion Vulnerability that allows any user to gain access to sensitive files such as the /etc/passwd file.

### **Target:** testphp.vulnweb.com

**Technical severity**: [V](https://hostcogent.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=56c2f1609abf8ac0808259d18&id=a9808ad4ad&e=7c378303b1)ery High

**Location of Vulnerability:** <http://testphpvulnweb.com/showimage.php?file=./pictures/1.jpg>

**Description & Solution:** I first reviewed the website and was paying close attention to the URL, looking for the potential of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulernabilities. I found that URLs to images within the site used scripts that accepted file names as parameters, such as with [**http://testphpvulnweb.com/showimage.php?file=./pictures/1.jpg**](http://testphpvulnweb.com/showimage.php?file=./pictures/1.jpg)

I then followed regular web traffic using Wireshark to identify the OS (Ubuntu), which told me that I could potentially gain access to the **.. / .. /etc/psswd** file through Local File Inclusion.

Next, I was able to crawl the website using getallurls and then filtered the results to exclude redirects to show less results.
