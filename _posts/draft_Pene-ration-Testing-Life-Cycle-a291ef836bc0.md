Penetration Testing Life Cycle
==============================


1. Planning and Reconnaissance

---

### Penetration Testing Life Cycle

### 1. Planning and Reconnaissance

* Define scope, objectives, and rules of engagement
* Gather information about the target
* Identify potential vulnerabilities *Relevant Tools:*
* nmap: Network scanning and service discovery tool
* Whois: Domain registration information lookup
* nslookup: DNS server query tool
* Shodan: Search engine for Internet-connected devices
* theHarvester: Email, domain, and subdomain information gathering
* Maltego: Graph-based data mining and analysis tool

  


### 2. Scanning

* Perform vulnerability scanning
* Enumerate and map target systems *Relevant Tools:*
* Nmap: Network scanning and service discovery tool
* Nessus: Vulnerability scanner and management platform
* OpenVAS: Open-source vulnerability scanning tool
* Nikto: Web server vulnerability scanner
* Metasploit: Exploitation and vulnerability testing framework
* Dirbuster: Directory and file enumeration tool

  


### 3. Gaining Access

* Exploit identified vulnerabilities
* Establish a foothold within the target system *Relevant Tools:*
* Metasploit: Exploitation and vulnerability testing framework
* Burp Suite: Web application security testing platform
* Sqlmap: SQL injection testing and exploitation tool
* Hydra: Password-cracking tool for various protocols
* OWASP ZAP: Web application vulnerability scanner and proxy
* BeEF: Browser exploitation framework

  


  


### 4. Maintaining Access

  


* Deploy persistent backdoors
* Escalate privileges
* Move laterally within the network *Relevant Tools:*
* Mimikatz: Credential extraction and manipulation tool
* PowerShell Empire: Post-exploitation framework
* Cobalt Strike: Penetration testing and threat emulation platform
* Psexec: Remote process execution tool
* CrackMapExec: Lateral movement and privilege escalation tool

  


### 5. Covering Tracks

* Erase traces of the penetration test
* Remove artifacts and logs *Relevant Tools:*
* CCleaner: System cleaning and optimization tool
* BleachBit: File, cache, and log cleaning tool
* Log2Timeline: Log and timeline analysis tool
* Sysinternals Suite (SDelete): Secure file deletion utility
* Rootkits: Stealthy and persistent backdoor tools

  


### 6. Reporting

* Document findings and recommendations
* Present the results to the client *Relevant Tools:*

Microsoft Office / LibreOffice: Document creation and editing suites

* Dradis: Collaboration and reporting platform
* MagicTree: Penetration testing data management tool
* Vulnreport: Vulnerability report generation and management tool
* Serpico: Penetration testing report generation and collaboration tool
