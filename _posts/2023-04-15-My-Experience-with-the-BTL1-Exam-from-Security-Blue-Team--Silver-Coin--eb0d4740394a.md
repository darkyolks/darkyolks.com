### My Experience with the BTL1 Exam from Security Blue Team (Silver Coin)

On 9/24/2022, I had the opportunity to take and pass the BTL1 exam, which is a 24-hour incident response-based scenario. The objective of the exam was to identify the source of a security breach by analyzing logs, conducting phishing analysis, mapping the attack using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, and ultimately determining the responsible party. I’d like to share my journey and insights from the experience.

### Preparation for the Exam

I started my preparation for the BTL1 exam on March 23, 2022, and took the test on September 24, 2022. I used an extended training course that provided ample time for studying and reviewing. My diligence paid off, as I passed the exam with a score of 80%, earning the silver challenge coin. I completed the exam in eight hours, even though I had 24 hours to do so, as I felt that constantly revisiting my answers could lead to overthinking.

### Domains Covered in the Exam

The BTL1 training course covers six critical domains: security fundamentals, phishing analysis, threat intelligence, digital forensics, security information and event monitoring (SIEM), and incident response. I found the phishing analysis domain to be particularly important and a must-know for anyone who uses a computer, as phishing is a widespread issue. The BTL1 training was an excellent resource for learning about this topic, among others.

I found that using tools such as Splunk and Wireshark greatly helped with my learning. I practiced all the labs multiple times, but I found that using Splunk and Wireshark the most was particularly beneficial for the exam.

### The Exam Environment

The BTL1 exam is conducted in a live lab environment, making it more challenging than traditional certification tests with multiple choice or performance-based questions. I personally prefer this type of exam as it is much more engaging and a better reflection of one’s skills. The live lab environment requires full attention and can be stressful, but it is a more fulfilling experience.

### Exam Results and Feedback

After submitting my answers, I received my exam results, which showed a score of 75%. Upon review, I submitted my answers for correction, and the security blue team exam-reviewers promptly responded, even on a weekend. One of my answers was corrected, which increased my score to 80%. I was pleased to receive the feedback, as it allowed me to identify areas for improvement and better prepare for future exams.

### Looking Ahead

With the BTL1 certificate under my belt, my focus has now shifted to the other end of the spectrum — the PNPT from TCM Security. The PNPT is the most challenging, as its material is similar to the well-known OSCP. I look forward to sharing my progress and experiences with these certifications in future blog posts.

\*I did end up taking a short break from my PNPT studies to knock out the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

In conclusion, obtaining the BTL1 certificate was a valuable and educational experience. I learned a lot about incident response, phishing analysis, and security fundamentals, and I would highly recommend this certification to anyone interested in these areas.
