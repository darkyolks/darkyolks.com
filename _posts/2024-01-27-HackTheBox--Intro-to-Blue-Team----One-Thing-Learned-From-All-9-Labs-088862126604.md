In this video, I go through each lab in the HackTheBox ‘Intro to Blue Team’ track. This track was created by HackTheBox and provides nine excellent, beginner friendly DFIR and SOC labs that can be investigated fully offline.

These boxes cover a few of the core concepts, tools and methodologies necessary to be an effective SOC Analyst and give you a good taste of what the process of DFIR actually looks like.

The labs featured in this Track are:

1. [Chase](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/157) — Forensics, PCAP analysis.
